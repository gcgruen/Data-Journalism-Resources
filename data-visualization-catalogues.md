What chart types are there? And how do I produce them?

For questions like these data visualization catalogues are really helpful starting point. 

[**Chart Decision Maker: A Thought Starter**](http://extremepresentation.typepad.com/files/choosing-a-good-chart-09.pdf) by [Andrew Abela](https://extremepresentation.com/about/) is the most basic one I usually recommend (and have printed & put on the wall at my desk because [Distracted Boyfriend Meme](https://twitter.com/xocasgv/status/901863006799323137)) as it gives a quick overview of which chart type to use when.

The [**Data Visualization Catalogue**](https://datavizcatalogue.com/) by [Severino Ribecca](https://twitter.com/sr_visual_info) is more elaborate: You can search by function or have a list of visualization types. Each type is shown as an icon and when you click, you get a more detailed description of this visualization type, a list of use cases and a list of tools you can realize this specific visual with.
The [**Dataviz Project**](http://datavizproject.com/) by the Danish design company [Ferdio](https://twitter.com/ferdiocom) is stuctured similarly and also features a wide variety of real-life examples for each chart tyoe.

The [**Visual Vocabulary**](https://github.com/ft-interactive/chart-doctor/blob/master/visual-vocabulary/Visual-vocabulary.pdf) by the [Financial Times team](https://www.ft.com/ft-data) is kind of a hybrid between the above ones: If you were to print it large enough, it still give an overview and also clusters by purpose. I found their little description really effective when talking to fellow reporters who are not familiar working with data & charts.

The [**Viusalization Universite**](http://visualizationuniverse.com/) by [Anna Vitals](https://twitter.com/annavitals), [Mark Vital](https://twitter.com/markvitals) and [Alexander Vushkan](https://twitter.com/alexzender) takes a more playful approach - that took me some time to get used to it, but if you are down for this kind of presentation it's definitely worth exploring: They have a section on charts, books and tools.

On a more practical side this [**Step-by-Step Design Guide for Data visualizations**](http://designingviz.com/) created by [Jonathan Soma](http://jonathansoma.com/) gives you what the title already promises: very on-point design advice for specific elements of a visualization (think scales, axes, colors). This [**Data visualization guidelines**](https://schoolofdata.org/2013/04/26/data-visualization-guidelines-by-gregor-aisch-international-journalism-festival/) by [Gregor Aisch](https://driven-by-data.net/) are a little bit older, but still today can help you avoid common mistakes and create better charts.
