# Data journalism learning resources

Where to start learning? That's a touch question and an easy one at the same time: There's no one-fits-all solution. Find yourself a project and [learn the tools you need](ddj-tools-list.md) to realize that.

If you want to go beyond, here's an ever-growing [list](http://bit.ly/learning-ddj) of graduate and post-graduate training programs, but I'm sure many are missing. In case you know of more educational programs, please let me know.

A few I would like to specifically highlight:

[**Learno by the European Journalism Centre**](http://learno.net/) offers a set of online courses on specific data journalism-related topics like Cleaning data in Excel or Mapping for journalists. It's free of cost.

[**Knight Center of the University of Texas**](https://knightcenter.utexas.edu/distancelearning) was the first ddj MOOC I participated in - and it was awesome! You have weekly video tutorials, readings and little projects to work through each week. A crucial part is also to give feedback to others and thereby learn how to critique data visualizations. They do not only offer ddj courses, but also on other journalism topics. It's pretty low cost (60 to 90 dollars).

[**Open Tech School**](http://www.opentechschool.org/) is a hybrid between online and offline courses: They have bunch of tutorials online (for example on [Python and Javascript](http://learn.opentechschool.org/)) and local groups that regularly meet up all across Europe. It's free of cost.

[**Columbia University's Lede Program**](http://ledeprogram.com/) is the one where I learnt coding. It's very expensive and I believe the ability to learn journalism skills should not be linked to your income - however, this was worth every dollar.
