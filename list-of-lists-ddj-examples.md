[Maarten Lambrecht](https://twitter.com/maartenzam)'s [list of 2016 data visualizations lists](http://www.maartenlambrechts.com/2016/12/29/the-list-of-2016-visualization-lists.html) (Inception loop level 3) was the inspiration for [this entire list project](README.md).
He also made a [list of 2017 dataviz lists](http://www.maartenlambrechts.com/2017/12/28/the-list-of-2017-visualization-lists.html).

Almost weekly, the [Global Investigative Editors Network](https://gijn.org/) selects the [Top 10 data journalism pieces of the week](https://gijn.org/series/top-10-data-journalism-links/) - definitely a great way to follow up on what is currently happening in the scene.

Then, there's the [list of awesome interactive journalism projects](https://github.com/wbkd/awesome-interactive-journalism) by [Webkid](https://webkid.io/).

People love maps and some maps being made are great and some visual information would be much more effective if it weren't presented as a map. The maps that are being made are very often choropleth maps, however, there's so much more to maps, as you can see on the [Carto blog](https://carto.com/blog/eighty-data-visualizations-examples-using-location-data-maps/).

Not neccessarily data journalism, but related: a [gallery of deep learning projects](http://deeplearninggallery.com/).
