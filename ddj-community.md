# Data Journalism Community

The data journalism community both online and offline is great and I find it always inspiring to see colleagues, exchange on projects and develop ideas together. There are multiple occasions to do so:


## Conferences

*If you can't afford ticket fees or travel expenses, I highly recommend the [Journalism Code Ticket + Travel Scholarships by Knight-funded OpenNews](https://opennews.org/what/community/scholarships/) (I applied for it myself once, it's uncomplicated and unbureaucratic) With their help, you can cover the ticket fee and receive 500 US-Dollar to cover travel expenses*

[**NICAR conference**](https://ire.org/conferences/nicar18/) in changing locations in the US - in March

[**International Journalism Festival**](https://www.journalismfestival.com/) in Perugia, Italy - in April

[**Dataharvest conference**](http://www.journalismfund.eu/european-investigative-journalism-dataharvest-conference) in Mechelen, Belgium - in May

[**European Data and Computational Journalism Conference**](http://datajconf.com/) in Cardiff, Wales - in June

[**netzwerk recherche Tagung**](https://netzwerkrecherche.org/termine/konferenzen/jahreskonferenzen/nr-jahreskonferenz-2018/) in Hamburg, Germany - in June

[**Global Investigative Journalists Network Conference**](https://gijn.org/global-conference-2/) happens every two years in different places in the world (2017 was in Johannesburg in South Africa), the next one scheduled for 2019 in Hamburg, Germany

## Regulars

I'm lucky to have lived in city's with a active data journalism and/or data visualization community on the ground. You should definitely check whether there's a [Hacks/Hackers chapter](https://hackshackers.com/) in your city! My go to page to figure out whether regular groups exist in a city is [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com) where you can enter your location and search through different topics (like Data Visualization, Data Journalism, PyLadies if you are into Python, Women Who Code if ...the name says it all) and will get a list of groups that meet frequently.


## Virtuals

[**NICAR-L**](https://www.ire.org/resource-center/listservs/subscribe-nicar-l/) is a mailing list that is good if you want to know what the questions and projects of other people around the world are. Since NICAR started our of the US, its most active members are from the US. People will send around examples and ask questions they want to discuss in the virtual community of more than 2000 subscribers. It's hard to put into a short sentence *what* questions exactly are discussed, just subscribe and see yourself.

It's also worth following the **hashtags `#dataviz` and `#ddj`** on Twitter. I made a dedicated Tweetdeck column for these hashtags and it's nice to browse through everyone's projects

[**European Data Journalism Network**](https://www.europeandatajournalism.eu/) is an "independent platform for data-driven news on European affairs" provided by a network of journalists and media outlets all across Europe.

**Code For...** there are by now many "Code for..." initatives - local ones in cities, nation-wide ones and even continent-wide ones like [Code for Africa](https://codeforafrica.org/) where developers, designers and journalists come together and work on projects. So it's not entirely and only virtual, but depending on your location also actual get togethers happen.
